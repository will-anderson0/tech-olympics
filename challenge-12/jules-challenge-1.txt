A computer scientist is designing an optimal binary search tree (BST) for a set of sorted keys 
{10,20,30,40,50}. The cost of searching for a key is proportional to its depth in the tree (root has depth 1, children of the root have depth 2, etc.).

If each key Kᵢ has a search frequency fᵢ given by:

f = {10 : 3, 20 : 5, 30 : 2, 40 : 7, 50 : 1}

What is the optimal BST structure that minimizes the weighted search cost?

   20
  /  \
10   40
    /  \
  30   50

Bonus: How does dynamic programming help solve this problem efficiently?
Dynamic programming helps solve this problem by breaking it into smaller, overlapping solutions and enables storing results of these subproblems in a table to avoid redundant calculations.
