Blackjack is a simple card game comprised of a dealer and a player. The player bets X amount of money, and the dealer deals two cards to the player face-up, and two cards to themselves, one face-up and 
one face-down. The "score" is calculated by adding the numbers on the cards together. For example, if a player has an 8 and a 7, they have a score of 15. 

Any face card has the value of 10.
An ace has the value of 1 or 11, and can change through the course of betting. 
Example:
A 6 = 17 or 7
A 6 8 = 15


After the initial deal, based on their score and the face-up card that the dealer has, the player can decide to "hit", meaning the dealer deals them another card, stand and keep there score, or double down- 
put up X amount of money again and receive ONLY one more card. If a player receives two cards with the same number, they are allowed to split those cards by putting up another bet of X. 
Splits must occur with identical cards (splitting two queens is okay, but you may not split a queen and a king despite them having the same value). 
The player is allowed to hit as many times as they want until they stand. However, if the player goes over a score of 21, they "bust" and lose the game. 
Once the player stands, the dealer then reveals their face-down card. They hit themselves until they reach a score of 17+ or bust.

Your job is to maximize your chances of winning each hand by deciding what to do in the following scenarios. You must decide to hit, split, stand, or double-down when applicable.
