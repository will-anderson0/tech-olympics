Directions: Reference a standard Chinook database model

Question: A particular creator is looking for some short audio clips that are dramatic or suspenseful. Give the id, name, and duration (in milliseconds) of any tracks from the “Quick clips” playlist are labeled with the genre of dramatic or suspenseful. 

Part One: Construct a Relational Algebra query

πTrackId,Name,Milliseconds(σGenre.Name=′Dramatic′∨Genre.Name=`Suspenseful′(σPlaylist.Name=′Quickclips ′(Playlist⋈PlaylistTrack⋈Track⋈Genre)))

Part Two: Construct a SQL query 

SELECT t.TrackId, t.Name, t.Milliseconds
FROM Track t
JOIN PlaylistTrack pt ON t.TrackId = pt.TrackId
JOIN Playlist p ON pt.PlaylistId = p.PlaylistId
JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE p.Name = 'Quick clips'
AND (g.Name = 'Dramatic' OR g.Name = 'Suspenseful');
